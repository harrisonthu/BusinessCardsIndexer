Objective:
We wanted to simplify the inconvience of storing business cards physically by converting them into an electronic format that could be accessed on a mobile device.

Technologies:
- Android Studio
- Java
- sqlite
- tesseract

Functionality:
It takes a photo of a business card, uses OCR to read the text from the card and then stores the image and the text in a searchable sqlite database.

Next steps:
- Make OCR more efficient
- Iron out kinks in the database
- Add search functionality
